Artificial Inteligence (AI) systems are taking over a lot of tasks, from communication systems to autonomous cars. These systems are usually made to respond to a very specific set of instructions and in very predictable ways. Not all of them are actually capable of engaging in an actual conversation with a human being, that at the of the day should be the entity to be pleased by AI systems. Human languages are very complex mechanisms and we wanted to start a simple AI that could understand some basic language syntax and learn from it. Once a simple AI system is established, it could exponentially grow from previous inputs and with enough time become complex enough to understand any instruction given.\r\n\r\n####_Project Description_\r\n\r\nLogicsAI is a simple AI system written in Python capable of understanding basic syntax components. Users with no experience are able to use the AI with ease and within a short period of time, the AI can understand several statements without problem. \r\n\r\n####_Authors and Contributors_\r\n\r\nThe LogicsAI project was developed in spring 2016 by a team consisting of Computer Engineering undergraduate students. The authors were taking the Programming Languages course of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The professor of the course and contributor of this project, Dr. Wilson Rivera Gallego, aided in the brainstorming and design of this project.  LogicsAI project was developed to be the subject of evaluation for the final project of the Programming Languages course. \r\n\r\n####_Required software:_\r\n- **Python CLI Interpreter**\r\n- **Anaconda** environment with the following installed dependencies\r\n  - numpy\r\n  - ply\r\n\r\n#### Running the LogicsAI Intepreter on *Windows*:\r\n\r\nAfter downloading the code, open the Command Line and set the path where the Zapdos folder is located:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\System> cd C:\\PL-LogicsAI\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen execute the following code:\r\n```\r\nC:\\LogicsAI> python Parse.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you should see the following:\r\n```\r\nlogicsai >>\r\n```\r\n#### Inserting LogicsAI code:\r\n\r\nJust write the line of code in the command, then press enter to store the code and enter the other line of code, and so on until finished.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing, run the following \"run\" command to run the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlogicsai >> run\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you're done!\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAvailable LogicsAI commands:\r\n- clear - Clear the current stored LogicsAI code.\r\n- run - Run the current stored LogicsAI code.\r\n- getall - get all the current subjects in memory\r\n- getcomplements - get all the current complements in memory\r\n- getobjects - get all the current objects in memory\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n##### Team:\r\n*Angel L.
